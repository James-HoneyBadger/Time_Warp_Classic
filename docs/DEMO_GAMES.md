## Game Development Learning

Each demo game teaches different programming concepts:

### **Beginner Concepts**
- Object creation and positioning
- Basic movement and collision
- Simple physics (Pong, Physics Demo)

### **Intermediate Concepts**
- Grid-based movement (Snake, Tetris)
- Player input handling (Platformer, Breakout)
- Object arrays and formations (Space Invaders)

### **Advanced Concepts**
- Physics simulation with momentum (Asteroids)
- Complex collision systems (Breakout)
- Game state management (Snake scoring)

## Using Game Templates

Create new projects based on these games:
1. **Game Dev Menu** → **Create Game Project**
2. Select a template (includes ready-to-modify code)
3. Learn by experimenting with the provided code
4. Build your own variations!

## Game Controls Reference

Most games respond to these common controls:
- **A/D** - Move left/right
- **W/S** - Move up/down or special actions
- **Space** - Action/shoot (where applicable)
- **Arrow Keys** - Alternative movement

## Extending the Games

Each demo provides a foundation you can build upon:
- Add scoring systems
- Create multiple levels
- Implement power-ups
- Add sound effects
- Create AI opponents
- Design custom graphics

## Technical Details

All games use Time_Warp's built-in game engine featuring:
- **Physics Simulation** - Gravity, velocity, collision detection
- **Object Management** - Create, move, delete game objects
- **Rendering System** - Real-time graphics updates
- **Event Handling** - Keyboard input processing

Start with simple modifications and gradually add more complex features as you learn!
