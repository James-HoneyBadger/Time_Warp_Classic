## Language Examples

### PILOT (Programmed Inquiry, Learning Or Teaching)
PILOT is an educational programming language designed for creating interactive lessons and quizzes.

- `math_quiz.pilot` - Interactive math quiz with conditional responses
- `adventure_game.pilot` - Simple text adventure using jump commands
- `turtle_shapes.pilot` - Turtle graphics demonstration

### BASIC (Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code)
Traditional line-numbered programming with Turbo BASIC extensions.

- `hello_world.bas` - Simple "Hello World" program
- `loop_demo.bas` - FOR loops and variable manipulation
- `turbo_features.bas` - Advanced Turbo BASIC commands (DO/LOOP, WHILE/WEND, SELECT CASE, INCR/DECR, SWAP)

### Logo
Turtle graphics programming language focused on educational geometry.

- `graphics_demo.logo` - Drawing geometric shapes (square, triangle, star)
- `recursive_graphics.logo` - Recursive patterns (spiral, tree)

### Python
Modern scripting language with extensive libraries and clean syntax.

- `data_analysis.py` - Data processing and statistical analysis
- `guessing_game.py` - Interactive number guessing game

### JavaScript
Web scripting language with modern features and async capabilities.

- `calculator.js` - Interactive command-line calculator
- `data_structures.js` - Arrays, objects, and modern JavaScript features

### Perl
Powerful text processing and system administration language.

- `text_processing.pl` - String manipulation, regex, and text analysis

### Pascal
Structured programming language emphasizing readability and modularity.

- `student_records.pas` - Records, procedures, functions, and data structures

### Prolog
Logic programming language based on formal logic and pattern matching.

- `family_logic.pl` - Family relationships and logical queries

### Forth
Stack-based programming language known for efficiency and low-level control.

- `stack_demo.fs` - Stack operations, word definitions, and mathematical functions

## Running the Examples

Load any of these programs into Time Warp IDE and run them to see the language features in action. Each program demonstrates key concepts and capabilities of its respective language.

## Educational Value

These examples are designed to:
- Showcase language-specific features and syntax
- Demonstrate programming concepts (loops, conditionals, functions, etc.)
- Provide starting points for learning each language
- Illustrate practical applications and use cases

For more advanced examples or to contribute new programs, see the main Time Warp documentation.
